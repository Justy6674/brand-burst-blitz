# ðŸ”§ FIX GIT AUTHOR TO JUSTY6674 - DIRECT REPLIT SOLUTION

## PROBLEM: 
Git commits showing "downscaleweight" instead of "Justy6674"

## SOLUTION:
Since Replit blocks direct Git operations, use Replit's built-in Git settings:

### STEP 1: Open Replit Settings
1. Click your profile (top right)
2. Go to "Account" settings
3. Find "Git Integration" section

### STEP 2: Update Git Identity
```
Name: Justy6674
Email: downscaleweightloss@gmail.com
```

### STEP 3: Alternative - Repository Settings
1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to "General" â†’ "Repository details"  
3. Update author information

### STEP 4: Force New Commit
Create any small change and commit through Replit's Git panel to test.

## VERIFICATION:
Next commit should show "Justy6674" instead of "downscaleweight"

**This bypasses all Git lock issues and sets the author correctly at the platform level.**
