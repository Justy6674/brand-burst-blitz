- [ ] PHASE 5 - REVIEW AND TURN INTO A PLAN IN THIS TODO!!!!!!!!!
On completion I want to work in the following - Please review, consider, and draft a new TODO with your suggestions for review 
AI-Assisted Professional Guidelines Portal for Australian Healthcare Practitioners

Overview of the Proposed Feature

You can absolutely implement a members-only Health Professionals section in your JBSAAS platform to cater to different practitioner types. The idea is to let users select their profession (e.g. Nurse Practitioner, Diabetes Educator, Midwife, Physio, Social Worker, Podiatrist, Psychologist, GP, Specialist, etc.) and then present them with tailored information on topics like Medicare billing rules, scope-of-practice regulations (AHPRA guidelines), therapeutic goods (TGA rules), and what they can/cannot do in private practice. This is entirely feasible ‚Äì especially by combining user selection with AI assistance ‚Äì and it will be extremely useful for practitioners in navigating the complex rules specific to their profession. Below, we break down how this can work and what content to include, all focused on the Australian health system (since you‚Äôre starting with Australia).

Profession-Specific Content and Rules

Each health profession in Australia has unique regulations and Medicare entitlements. The portal should allow the user to select their profession, then display the relevant guidelines and Medicare item numbers, as well as any limits on their practice. An AI assistant can help by automatically filtering or highlighting content once the profession is chosen, and even by answering free-form questions the user asks. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of key points for each type of practitioner in private practice:
	‚Ä¢	Nurse Practitioners (NPs): Eligible nurse practitioners can register for Medicare provider numbers and bill specific MBS items for the services they provide Ôøº Ôøº. In private practice, an NP can perform consultations (including telehealth) and participate in care conferences under their own MBS item codes Ôøº, as long as they meet the item requirements. They must be endorsed by the Nursing and Midwifery Board (NMBA) and satisfy all registration standards (including having appropriate indemnity insurance and collaborative arrangements) Ôøº. Nurse practitioners are allowed to request certain pathology tests and diagnostic imaging for their patients within their scope Ôøº Ôøº. For example, NPs may order pathology in MBS Groups P1‚ÄìP8 (common blood tests, etc.) and a range of imaging studies ‚Äì but not every test (some high-end scans like certain MRIs/PET scans remain restricted) Ôøº Ôøº. They can also refer patients to medical specialists when needed (just like a GP would) Ôøº. In terms of medications, an NP with a PBS prescriber number can prescribe medications within a specified formulary (‚Äúselected listed medicines‚Äù under the PBS) appropriate to their role Ôøº. However, their prescribing is limited to their competence and state/territory prescribing rights, and often collaborative arrangements require notifying a doctor of prescriptions. All these capabilities mean that nurse practitioners in private practice have a broad but clearly-defined scope: they can independently manage patients, bill Medicare for NP items, order many investigations, and prescribe ‚Äì within the rules (e.g. having the proper endorsement and only billing for services they personally provided in a private setting Ôøº).
	‚Ä¢	Midwives (Eligible Private Practice Midwives): Similar to NPs, endorsed midwives can access specific MBS items and must have their own Medicare provider numbers when working in private practice Ôøº Ôøº. They have Medicare items for antenatal, intrapartum (delivery) and postnatal care under the Midwifery Services group Ôøº. An eligible midwife can order certain tests (typically maternity-related pathology and scans) and refer women to obstetricians or pediatricians if a situation requires specialist input Ôøº. For example, midwives can refer their patients for ultrasound scans during pregnancy and common blood tests, but like NPs they are limited to what the law permits them to request or prescribe. An endorsed midwife is authorized (by NMBA endorsement) to prescribe scheduled medicines (Schedule 2, 3, 4, 8) relevant to midwifery practice, in line with state law Ôøº. As with NPs, midwives must work in private practice or a suitably authorized setting (not as a standard public hospital employee) to bill Medicare; they cannot charge Medicare for services to public hospital patients Ôøº. The platform should enumerate the Medicare item numbers and rules for midwives, such as how many postnatal visits are covered, documentation needed for maternity care plans, etc., and highlight that they too must maintain registration, indemnity insurance, and endorsements Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	General Practitioners (GPs) and Medical Specialists: Fully qualified medical doctors (MBBS/MD with general or specialist registration) have the broadest Medicare and practice privileges. A GP in private practice can bill a wide range of MBS items ‚Äì standard consultation items, chronic disease management plans, mental health care plans, telehealth, procedures, etc. ‚Äì as long as they fulfill the item requirements. Specialists (e.g. cardiologists, dermatologists) have their own consultation and procedure item numbers. One key Medicare rule for specialists is that patients generally need a referral from a GP (or another doctor) to claim Medicare benefits for a specialist consultation Ôøº (this keeps continuity of care and is a Medicare requirement). Both GPs and specialists can request any necessary pathology or imaging for their patients; there is no blanket restriction on doctors ordering tests, though certain expensive imaging studies have specific criteria for Medicare rebates. For instance, some MRI scans will only attract a Medicare rebate if ordered by a specialist or if certain clinical criteria are met ‚Äì these rules are detailed in the MBS (e.g. GP-referred MRI of the knee is covered only in specific cases). In general, however, doctors are authorized requesters for all standard tests, unlike allied health or nurses who have a limited list Ôøº Ôøº. Doctors also have full prescribing rights for approved medicines (within state/territory prescribing laws), meaning a GP or specialist can prescribe any medication on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) if it aligns with PBS criteria, and even prescribe off-label or unapproved medicines via Special Access Scheme if needed. The portal might not need to spoon-feed all general doctor knowledge (since GPs know what they can do), but it‚Äôs helpful to include reminders of Medicare rules such as not billing Medicare for services provided to public inpatients, ensuring a valid provider number for each practice location, and following proper billing for co-consultations or aftercare. Additionally, highlighting any recent changes (for example, new telehealth item numbers or changes in consult time-tier thresholds) keeps even doctors up-to-date. Essentially, for medical practitioners the system would reinforce Medicare requirements (e.g. claiming limits, referral rules) and perhaps the need for referrals and documentation (like care plans) in coordinating with other providers Ôøº Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Allied Health Professionals (Physio, Podiatry, Dietitian, etc.): Allied health providers have access to Medicare billing only in specific contexts, and they have more restrictions on ordering tests or treatments compared to doctors. Under Medicare‚Äôs Chronic Disease Management (CDM) program, allied health professionals can see patients who are referred by a GP with a care plan. These are the items 10950‚Äì10970 range, which allow up to 5 allied health visits per patient per year (in any mix of allied professions) for patients with chronic conditions Ôøº Ôøº. For example, a physiotherapist can bill item 10960 for a standard consult if the patient has a valid GP referral under a care plan Ôøº. Podiatrists, dietitians, diabetes educators, exercise physiologists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, etc. each have their corresponding item number for these referrals (the platform can list each profession‚Äôs item code for quick reference) Ôøº. Billing requirements for these items are strict: the service must be at least 20 minutes, one-on-one (no group therapy under these particular items), and you must send a report back to the referring GP Ôøº Ôøº. Additionally, there are caps ‚Äì no more than 5 sessions per year per patient across all allied health CDM items, and the patient must not be an in-patient of a hospital when receiving the service Ôøº Ôøº. Your portal should make these requirements clear so that, say, a physiotherapist in private practice understands they can‚Äôt just bill Medicare for any patient ‚Äì the patient needs a care plan and referral.
Scope of practice and ordering: Allied health professionals generally cannot directly claim Medicare rebates for ordering pathology or specialist referrals. Their role is usually to treat within their modality and refer back to a doctor if further investigations or specialist consults are needed. However, Medicare does permit some allied health practitioners to request a limited set of diagnostic imaging services. According to the MBS, for instance, chiropractors and physiotherapists/osteopaths can order certain plain X-rays and ultrasounds (specific item numbers in the 57xxx and 58xxx series are allocated to them) Ôøº Ôøº. Podiatrists can also refer patients for certain diagnostic imaging of the foot/ankle (there are dedicated radiology item numbers for podiatry referrals) Ôøº. These orders are limited in scope ‚Äì complex imaging like MRI or CT, and virtually all pathology tests, still require a medical practitioner or NP referral for Medicare coverage. The platform can list which imaging tests each allied health profession can order under Medicare (so they know, for example, a podiatrist can directly request an X-ray for a foot injury and have it rebated). If an allied health professional orders something outside these allowances, the patient might have to pay privately or the service may refuse to proceed without a doctor‚Äôs request. It‚Äôs best practice for allied health in private practice to coordinate with GPs for any investigations or specialist referrals needed. In summary, the portal‚Äôs content for allied health should emphasize Medicare billing pathways (GP referrals required, item numbers), scope of practice limits (e.g. no independent pathology requests under Medicare), and encourage working within care teams.
	‚Ä¢	Mental Health Providers (Psychologists, Social Workers & Others under Better Access): Australia‚Äôs Better Access initiative allows certain allied mental health professionals to provide Medicare-funded mental health services. Clinical psychologists, registered (general) psychologists, accredited mental health social workers, and certain occupational therapists can all deliver therapy under this program, if they have a referral from a GP (or psychiatrist/paediatrician) with a Mental Health Treatment Plan Ôøº. The system should outline the item numbers and session limits: currently, patients can get Medicare rebates for up to 10 individual therapy sessions per calendar year (and some group sessions) with these professionals, as part of Better Access. For example, a clinical psychologist uses item 80000 (and related codes) for therapy, while an eligible social worker uses item 80150 and related codes for providing Focused Psychological Strategies Ôøº. All providers must meet specific eligibility criteria (e.g. psychologists need full registration; social workers must be accredited by the AASW as mental health social workers) and hold a Medicare provider number Ôøº. The portal can list such criteria and remind users that a valid referral and Mental Health Plan are required before providing these services. In private practice, psychologists have broad ability to practice (within ethical bounds), but they cannot prescribe medications or order medical investigations independently ‚Äì they collaborate with medical practitioners for those needs. Social workers and OTs in mental health likewise focus on therapy within their scope. All must adhere to documentation requirements (like reporting back to the referrer after a certain number of sessions). Including a summary of Better Access rules (like needing to report to the GP after 6 sessions, etc.) would be helpful content for these users.
	‚Ä¢	Other Categories: You mentioned Diabetes Educators specifically ‚Äì many diabetes educators are nurses or allied health professionals (dietitians, pharmacists, etc.) who have additional certification. They actually appear in Medicare‚Äôs allied health items (item 10951 for a diabetes education service under a GP care plan) Ôøº. So a diabetes educator in private practice would use those CDM items (5 visits/year limit, etc. as discussed above). They might also be involved in group services (for example, Medicare has group education items for Type 2 Diabetes under certain programs). If your platform grows, you might eventually include content for pharmacists (e.g. about vaccination or medication review programs) or others ‚Äì but initially focusing on the listed professions is plenty. Each profession‚Äôs section of the portal can have subtopics like ‚ÄúMedicare Billing‚Äù, ‚ÄúScope of Practice & Referrals‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrescribing/Medications‚Äù, and ‚ÄúRegulatory Guidelines‚Äù to organize the information.

Regulatory Requirements (AHPRA and TGA Rules)

In addition to Medicare billing rules, private practitioners must follow professional regulations from bodies like AHPRA (Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, with the National Boards) and TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration). Your portal should provide an overview of these rules as they pertain to each profession:
	‚Ä¢	AHPRA and National Boards: All the listed health professions (except unregistered ones like Social Workers, who have their own association standards) are regulated by a National Board under AHPRA. Practitioners must be registered with their board and meet ongoing standards ‚Äì this includes holding current registration, not practicing outside their scope, and meeting continuing professional development requirements, among others Ôøº. For example, to practice as a Nurse Practitioner or an endorsed midwife, the person needs to maintain their NMBA registration with the required endorsement (which confirms their qualifications for advanced practice and prescribing) Ôøº. The portal can list the basic AHPRA requirements: registration standards, professional codes of conduct, and guidelines that apply in private practice. One critical area is advertising and use of titles. AHPRA has strict Advertising Guidelines for any health service advertising ‚Äì all professions must avoid false or misleading claims, guarantees of cures, and testimonials, as these are illegal to use in advertising health services Ôøº. There are also hefty penalties (recently increased up to $60,000 for an individual) for breaching advertising rules under the National Law Ôøº. Your AI assistant could remind a user, for instance, that if they create a webpage or Facebook ad for their clinic, they cannot include patient testimonials or claim to ‚Äúcure‚Äù a condition ‚Äì that would violate AHPRA/TGA advertising regulations. Additionally, certain professional titles are protected; only those with the proper registration can use them. (A timely example: only specific specialists can call themselves a ‚Äúsurgeon‚Äù ‚Äì new rules were introduced restricting who can use the title ‚Äúcosmetic surgeon‚Äù, etc. Ôøº.) For a physiotherapist or podiatrist in private practice, the portal might highlight scope of practice guidance: they should only provide treatments they are trained and licensed for, and if they perform higher-risk procedures (like podiatric surgery or acupuncture), they need specific endorsements or certifications. Essentially, the AHPRA section of the content ensures the practitioner knows their obligations to practice ethically and legally: maintain registration, use correct titles, follow the relevant Code of Conduct for their profession, get informed consent, maintain patient records properly, and so on. Because these rules are quite extensive, the AI assistant could be helpful by allowing users to ask specific questions (‚ÄúCan I call myself a ‚Äòspecialist in X‚Äô on my website if I‚Äôm a GP?‚Äù) ‚Äì and then providing an answer based on AHPRA‚Äôs published guidelines (in that example, the answer would be no, you shouldn‚Äôt misuse titles).
	‚Ä¢	TGA and Therapeutic Goods Rules: The TGA regulates medications, medical devices, and other therapeutic goods in Australia. For health professionals, the key points to cover are about prescribing and advertising therapeutic products:
	‚Ä¢	Prescribing and use of medications: Practitioners can only prescribe medicines they are authorized to. Doctors have broad authority, whereas NPs and endorsed midwives have a limited formulary (as noted earlier). Some allied health, like endorsed podiatrists or optometrists, have rights to prescribe a subset of drugs relevant to their field. The portal content should stress that any prescription of unapproved medicines (not listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods) must go through special TGA pathways (e.g. Special Access Scheme or Authorized Prescriber scheme). If the user base includes, say, a psychiatrist interested in off-label use of a novel drug, the AI assistant could outline the TGA Special Access Scheme process. For now, a general note that practitioners must comply with TGA rules for supplying unregistered therapies is useful.
	‚Ä¢	Advertising/Supplying therapeutic goods: In private practice, some health professionals also sell or recommend products (vitamins, devices, etc.). It‚Äôs important they know that you cannot advertise prescription-only medicines to the general public, and you must not advertise any therapeutic goods that are not approved by TGA Ôøº. For instance, a clinic‚Äôs website shouldn‚Äôt promote a new stem-cell therapy or a Schedule 4 medication brand to lure patients ‚Äì that would breach TGA advertising law. Even on social media, testimonials about therapeutic products are prohibited, and any claims must be compliant (the TGA has an advertising code) Ôøº. If your portal is for members only (health professionals), certain discussions of off-label uses or products might be permissible in that closed context (since advertising restrictions mainly target public advertising). Still, it‚Äôs wise to include guidance like: If you plan to advertise treatments on your site or brochures, ensure they meet the TGA‚Äôs advertising code and AHPRA rules. This might include listing the standard warning that accompanies ads (e.g. ‚ÄúAlways read the label‚Ä¶ use only as directed‚Ä¶‚Äù for pharmacy medicines) in appropriate cases. The system could also push updates on TGA regulatory changes, for example if the TGA issues a new warning or reclassifies a substance relevant to that profession.

In summary, a Regulatory Compliance section of each profession‚Äôs page (or a general part of the portal) would cover AHPRA rules (registration, scope, advertising, professional conduct) and TGA rules (medicines and devices usage and advertising). By providing this, your platform ensures that users not only know how to get paid (Medicare) but also how to stay out of trouble legally and ethically.

AI Assistance for Personalization and Q&A

Implementing this feature with AI assistance will make it much more powerful and user-friendly. Here‚Äôs how AI can help in the background:
	‚Ä¢	Smart Content Filtering: Once the user selects their profession (and possibly sub-interests like ‚Äúbilling‚Äù or ‚Äúprescribing‚Äù), an AI can automatically filter the knowledge base and present the most relevant snippets or FAQs. For example, if a user selects ‚ÄúPhysiotherapist‚Äù and ‚ÄúMedicare item numbers‚Äù, the system could display a summary of the CDM program items (e.g. ‚ÄúAs a physio, you can bill MBS item 10960 for individual therapy with a valid referral Ôøº. Remember it must be ‚â•20 minutes face-to-face and part of a GP Management Plan.‚Äù). This saves the user from scrolling through irrelevant info meant for other professions.
	‚Ä¢	Interactive Q&A: An AI chatbot or assistant in the members‚Äô area would allow practitioners to ask natural language questions about the rules. Busy professionals might prefer to type a question like, ‚ÄúCan a nurse practitioner order an MRI of the spine, or does a GP need to do it?‚Äù instead of reading a long policy document. The AI, having been fed the relevant data (like the MBS notes and guidelines we discussed), could answer: ‚ÄúNurse Practitioners can directly request many diagnostic imaging services under Medicare, but MRI scans are generally restricted ‚Äì only certain MRI items can be ordered by GPs or NPs, and others require a specialist referral Ôøº. So, for a spine MRI, a specialist referral might be needed for Medicare rebate unless it falls under an exempt item.‚Äù This kind of on-demand answer is extremely valuable. It‚Äôs like having a compliance expert on call. You would need to ensure the AI‚Äôs knowledge is up-to-date and accurate (likely by curating the source material and using a reliable model), because giving incorrect advice on these matters could mislead users. But with the proper data (e.g. official guidelines like those we‚Äôve cited), an AI can be very effective.
	‚Ä¢	AI-Suggested Alerts or Tips: The system could also use AI to suggest content the user might not have explicitly asked for but is likely to need. For example, if a user indicates they are a Podiatrist, the platform might proactively show: ‚ÄúPodiatry Medicare Tip: Did you know you can refer patients for certain foot X-rays and have them rebated? See the list of MBS-approved imaging items for podiatrists.‚Äù Ôøº. Or if a user selects Psychologist, the AI might highlight: ‚ÄúKeep in mind the 10-session annual limit under Better Access Ôøº, and that you‚Äôll need a new GP referral after the initial 6 sessions.‚Äù These context-aware tips help ensure the user doesn‚Äôt miss important details they might not have thought to query.

Overall, combining user-driven selection with AI-driven assistance (‚Äúboth‚Äù approaches) will make the portal powerful yet easy to navigate. The user stays in control of what they‚Äôre looking for, but the AI makes sure they quickly get the right answers and even pointers to things they should be aware of. This addresses your idea of ‚ÄúBoth - that the user selects (AI assisted)‚Äù ‚Äì the interface could allow manual browsing of topics and also an AI helper for questions.

Push Notifications and Updates

Enabling push notifications (or email/SMS alerts) for users who opt in is an excellent idea ‚Äì ‚ÄúYes, definitely‚Äù this is possible and beneficial. The healthcare rules landscape changes frequently (Medicare item updates, new guidelines, etc.), so keeping users updated will add a lot of value to your platform. Here‚Äôs how you can implement it:
	‚Ä¢	User Subscription to Topics: Let the user check a box or toggle ‚ÄúNotify me of updates‚Äù for their profession or for specific topics (e.g. ‚ÄúMedicare changes‚Äù, ‚ÄúDrug prescribing rules‚Äù). For instance, a diabetes educator might subscribe to Medicare updates and NDSS news, whereas a GP might subscribe to MBS updates and PBS/TGA alerts. Since your platform is initially Australian-only, you can focus on Australian news.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate Official Update Feeds: Sources like MBS Online, PBS, AHPRA, and the TGA often publish news or updates:
	‚Ä¢	The Department of Health (MBS) has a news page and a subscription service Ôøº. You could aggregate important announcements such as new item numbers or rule changes. For example, it was announced that ‚Äúfrom 1 March 2025, there are changes to nurse practitioner MBS items‚Äù Ôøº ‚Äì users with the NP role would appreciate a notification about that with a short summary.
	‚Ä¢	AHPRA releases guidelines updates or new standards (for example, if the Advertising Guidelines get updated or a new Code of Conduct is released). Your system could monitor AHPRA‚Äôs news and alert relevant users. If AHPRA issues a new practice guideline for, say, telehealth for psychologists, you‚Äôd send that out to psychology professionals.
	‚Ä¢	TGA often issues safety advisories or changes scheduling of drugs. If, hypothetically, the TGA reclassified a medication that NPs commonly prescribe, you‚Äôd notify the NP users: ‚ÄúTGA Update: Medicine X is now Schedule 4 (prescription only) ‚Äì ensure you have authority to prescribe.‚Äù Similarly, if advertising rules change (like they did increasing penalties, or new rules on social media), you can push that info Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	Custom Notifications and Frequency: You can decide how to send these ‚Äì possibly as push notifications in-app, emails, or even mobile push if you have an app. The key is to not overwhelm the user. Perhaps a monthly digest of changes for each profession, plus urgent alerts for major immediate changes, is a balanced approach. Allow users to fine-tune what they get (some might want only major changes, others might want all news).
	‚Ä¢	Example ‚Äì Medicare Item Changes: If Medicare introduces new item numbers or alters requirements (which happens with yearly budget updates and COVID-era changes), your system should alert those affected. E.g., ‚ÄúNew Medicare item for telehealth extended consults available for GPs ‚Äì effective from next month.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúMidwives: MBS prolonged postnatal visit item now requires documentation of a care plan Ôøº.‚Äù These real-time updates will save practitioners from missing out on billable opportunities or from billing incorrectly.

By providing this push notification service, you‚Äôre effectively acting as a personalized regulatory watch for your users. This keeps them in compliance and up-to-date without them having to constantly check government websites. Just ensure that the information you send out is accurate and sourced (you might include a link or reference to official info in the notification details).

Conclusion

In conclusion, yes ‚Äì it is entirely possible (and awesome!) to build this AI-assisted, profession-tailored section in your JBSAAS members area. The key components will be: a robust knowledge base of Australian health practice rules (Medicare, AHPRA, TGA, etc.), the ability for the user to specify their professional role, and AI tools to help filter information and answer questions dynamically. By focusing on Australian content, you ensure everything is relevant (e.g. using Australian terminology, item numbers, agencies). As your platform grows, you could expand to other countries or additional professions, but starting with the Australian health industry is wise given the depth of information to cover.

This feature will greatly help practitioners in private practice by providing one-stop access to what they can and cannot do ‚Äì from what they‚Äôre allowed to bill, to what referrals or prescriptions they can write, to what legal/regulatory obligations they must uphold. With AI assistance, using the portal will be intuitive: they get quick answers and don‚Äôt have to read through dry government manuals (though you‚Äôll have those sources underpinning the info). And with push notifications for updates, they‚Äôll stay current effortlessly.

Overall, implementing this is a fantastic idea that leverages technology to ease the compliance burden on health professionals. It‚Äôs a feasible project: all the necessary information is publicly available from authoritative sources, and modern AI can be harnessed to make that information accessible and personalized. By proceeding with this plan, you‚Äôll be offering a truly valuable service to your users ‚Äì helping them practice with confidence that they are following Medicare rules, AHPRA guidelines, and TGA regulations correctly (and getting paid appropriately for their services!). In short, it‚Äôs not only possible ‚Äì it‚Äôs an excellent innovation for your platform. üéâ
