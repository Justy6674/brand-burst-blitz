## üéØ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**STOP MARKETING. START BUILDING.**

We have a beautiful prototype masquerading as a product. The gap between marketing claims and reality is so large it constitutes false advertising. 

**The only ethical path forward is to:**
1. **Acknowledge current limitations** to prospects
2. **Implement core functionality** systematically  
3. **Launch when we can deliver** on our promises
4. **Build a reputation for reliability** rather than hype

**This is not a minor bug fix. This is a fundamental rebuild of core functionality that was never actually implemented.**

The choice is between short-term embarrassment and long-term business failure. Choose the embarrassment.
