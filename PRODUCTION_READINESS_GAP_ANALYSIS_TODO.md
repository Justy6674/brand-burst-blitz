SYSTEM:
You're JBSAAS's expert AI builder. Every response must obey these rules:

1. **Dual Hat Mode**  
   ‚Ä¢ **Ruthless Full-Stack Developer** ‚Äì insist on perfect architecture, edge-case coverage, performance, security (RLS, auth, input validation), full stack implementation (React/TS + Tailwind, Supabase migrations & Edge Functions), and 100% test coverage.  
   ‚Ä¢ **Fussy SaaS Founder** ‚Äì demand crystal-clear UX, no placeholders, zero broken flows, business value upfront, Australian compliance, polished UI, mobile-responsive, measurable ROI.

2. **Phased Delivery (Phases 1‚Äì5)**  
   a. **Phase 1: Core** (auth, onboarding, content gen basics)  
   b. **Phase 2: Social Integration** (FB/IG OAuth, posting, scheduling)  
   c. **Phase 3: Analytics & Insights** (real data collection, dashboards)  
   d. **Phase 4: Advanced Workflows** (smart calendar, automations, external sync)  
   e. **Phase 5: Aussie Specialization** (ABN/ASIC, GST, local events, compliance).  
   üëâ Complete each phase fully (code + tests + docs + RLS policies) before moving on‚Äîno skipping or "phase bleed."

3. **No Placeholders, No "TODO"s**  
   Every API, component, migration, and UI must be fully functional. If it isn't trivial, ask for clarification rather than stub.

4. **User-Centric Non-Tech Flows**  
   Build members-only features that a non-technical business owner can use unassisted. E.g. one-click blog embeds for WordPress/GoDaddy/Wix, fallback to AI content & image generator, guided wizards, clear error tooltips, help links to Meta, ABN lookup, etc.

5. **Australian Focus & Compliance**  
   ‚Äì Enforce Australia-only signup (country field + IP soft-gate + waitlist).  
   ‚Äì Integrate ABN validation and ASIC name checks.  
   ‚Äì Display AHPRA/TGA or ASIC/AFSL compliance reminders in relevant industries.  
   ‚Äì Use Australian English and local date/time conventions.

6. **Approval Gate**  
   After each deliverable, stop and ask "Does this meet your standards before merging?"‚Äîdo not overwrite existing code without explicit green light.

7. **Alignment to README & TODOs**  
   Always cross-check against the master README, we do everything via a TODO thus this needs building for every development - current file contains some that have been done or partially done, thus create a system you can track current TOD - and past completed TODO's so you are not confused, and the Phased Roadmap. Call out any conflict and propose a resolution.

8. **Validation & QA**  
   After each implementation:  
   ‚Äì Run end-to-end tests (unit, integration, UI).  
   ‚Äì Validate no regressions in public-facing pages.  
   ‚Äì Confirm business impact (e.g., "Sign up works in 5s with clear Aussie-only messaging"). This is a very very important build and yo must never be lazy, always perfectionist, never rush, never produce something just to look good and please. Always spell Australian but no silly slang - classy and proper. Full Stack, the calendar function in the members area is the engine room and needs to be the quality of google and apple and truely smart. Users must easily be able to use it, connect it, and run multiple businesses form it, slecting easily for example like they do in google. The app is attempting to allow BLOG's for searchability, social media posting for engagement. We know META makes things difficult and not trying to ficgh that. We are trting to be fully AI integrated everywehere we can, and realise many or most users are not tech savvy thus trying to add a gap in the market that many find out the hard way or sepnd hundreds of thousands of dollars to tech and marketing agencies. We would love to connect with google analytics and ads where possible if easy
   WE NEED YOU TO SUGGEST BUILD ADDITIONS THAT WILL VALUE ADD IF EASILY IMPLIMENTED AND BENEFICIAL!!!!!!!!!!

When you're ready, ask "Which feature in Phase 1 shall we build first?"  ---

- [ ] **high** FAQ - Common questions section. Now rebuild is nearly done - outline common questions after assessing the whole site, and draft 40 common questions, and format in 4 sections thus 10 in each that are clear for the user to view, Australian Healthcare focused, everything you think they will ask as a fussy consumer. Present you questions to the owner for approval! as an example - I can see from the console logs that there's an error with `ComingSoonPopup is not defined` in the CommonQuestions component. Let me examine the current CommonQuestions.tsx file to understand what's causing the issue and then help you create 40 healthcare-focused questions. My FAQ suggestions: I'll examine the current CommonQuestions.tsx file first to understand the structure, then draft all 40 questions and answers in the 4 sections you requested.

Now let me check the rest of the file to see the complete structure:

I can see the issue - there's a `ComingSoonPopup` component being used but it's missing the import statement. Now let me also check what that component looks like to make sure I include it properly:

Perfect! Now I can see that the `ComingSoonPopup` component exists and is imported in other files but missing from `CommonQuestions.tsx`. I also see the current structure has 5 categories but you want 4 categories with 10 questions each (40 total).

## Current Issue & Solution

**The Problem:** The `ComingSoonPopup` component is being used in the CommonQuestions.tsx file but the import statement is missing, causing a runtime error.

**The Current Structure:** The file currently has 5 categories with varying numbers of questions (around 30 total), but you want 4 categories with exactly 10 questions each (40 total).

## Here are the 40 Questions & Answers in 4 Sections:

### **Section 1: AHPRA Compliance & Professional Standards** (10 Questions)

1. **How does AHPRA compliance validation work?**
   Our AI automatically screens all generated content against AHPRA advertising guidelines. We check for prohibited therapeutic claims, ensure appropriate professional boundaries are maintained, and flag any content that could violate advertising standards. Every piece of content receives a compliance score before publication.

2. **What TGA guidelines does the platform follow?**
   We integrate TGA therapeutic goods advertising guidelines into our content generation. The platform automatically prevents claims about treating, curing, or preventing diseases unless you have appropriate TGA approvals. We maintain an updated database of prohibited claims and automatically flag potential violations.

3. **How do you ensure patient privacy in content creation?**
   All content generation follows Australian Privacy Principles for health information. We never use patient data in content creation, maintain strict data segregation, and ensure no patient-identifiable information can appear in generated content. All healthcare content focuses on general education rather than specific patient cases.

4. **Can I advertise across multiple Australian states with different regulations?**
   Yes, our platform understands state-specific healthcare advertising variations. We automatically adjust content based on your practice locations, ensuring compliance with both national AHPRA guidelines and any additional state-specific requirements, particularly for services like psychology and physiotherapy.

5. **What happens if AHPRA guidelines change?**

7. **Can I make before/after claims in my content?**
   AHPRA prohibits testimonials and before/after images that make therapeutic claims. Our platform helps you create compliant content that educates patients about procedures and outcomes without violating advertising guidelines. We focus on general information rather than specific treatment promises.

8. **What about professional indemnity insurance considerations?**
   Our platform ensures all generated content falls within your scope of practice and doesn't create additional professional indemnity risks. We help you communicate your expertise without making claims that could extend beyond your insurance coverage or professional qualifications.

9. **How does this work with practice accreditation requirements?**
   Content creation supports practice accreditation by demonstrating patient education efforts, professional development engagement, and community health contributions. Our platform helps you document these activities for accreditation purposes while maintaining compliance.

10. **Can I use patient case studies in my content?**
    No, AHPRA prohibits patient testimonials and case studies in healthcare advertising. Our platform helps you create general educational content that demonstrates your expertise without using specific patient information. We focus on condition education rather than treatment stories.

I can see the issue! The `CommonQuestions.tsx` file is referencing `ComingSoonPopup` but it's not imported. The error occurs around line 1027 where there's likely a usage of this undefined component.

Let me check if this component exists and see the rest of the file:

Now I can see the issue! The problem is on line 327 where `ComingSoonPopup` is used but not imported. Let me check if this component exists:

Perfect! The issue is clear now. The `ComingSoonPopup` component exists in `src/components/common/ComingSoonPopup.tsx`, but it's not imported in the `CommonQuestions.tsx` file. This is why you're getting the "ComingSoonPopup is not defined" error.

Looking at the current healthcare-focused FAQ structure, I can see you already have 30 questions across 5 categories (6 questions each). To create 40 questions in 4 sections as you requested, I'll need to reorganize and expand the content.

**Issue Fix & Content Expansion Plan:**

**IMMEDIATE FIX:**
- Add missing import for `ComingSoonPopup` component to resolve the runtime error

**CONTENT RESTRUCTURING (40 Questions in 4 Sections):**

**Section 1: AHPRA Compliance & Professional Standards (10 questions)**

#### **Core Philosophy: Work WITH Platform Restrictions, Not Against Them**
Meta's healthcare API restrictions make direct integration impossible. The copy-paste approach is strategically superior.

#### **SOCIAL PUBLISHING PIPELINE - REAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

**Component 1: Healthcare Copy-Paste Workflow (`HealthcareCopyPasteWorkflow.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Actual Implementation Required:
interface CopyPasteWorkflow {
  contentGeneration: AHPRACompliantGenerator;
  platformOptimization: PlatformSpecificFormatter;
  complianceValidation: RealTimeAHPRACheck;
  clipboardIntegration: CopyToClipboardButtons;
  performanceTracking: ManualAnalyticsEntry;
}
```

**Component 2: Platform-Specific Content Optimization**
- **Facebook**: Educational posts with medical disclaimers (2200 char limit)
- **Instagram**: Visual-focused with AHPRA-compliant hashtags (2200 char limit)  
- **LinkedIn**: Professional networking appropriate healthcare content
- **Copy Buttons**: "Copy for Facebook", "Copy for Instagram", "Copy for LinkedIn"

**Component 3: Real-Time AHPRA Compliance Validation**
- **Before Copy**: Content receives compliance score (0-100%)
- **Red Flag Blocking**: Automatic blocking of prohibited terms
- **Professional Boundaries**: Maintained across all generated content
- **TGA Compliance**: No therapeutic claims without evidence

#### **ANALYTICS REPLACEMENT - USER-DRIVEN APPROACH**

**Instead of Fake Mock Data:**
1. **Manual Performance Entry Interface**
   ```typescript
   interface PostPerformanceEntry {
     postContent: string;
     platform: 'facebook' | 'instagram' | 'linkedin';
     likes: number;
     comments: number;
     shares: number;
     patientInquiries: number;
     datePosted: Date;
   }
   ```

2. **Public Data Competitor Analysis** (Ethical & Legal)
   - Public post engagement analysis
   - Content theme identification
   - Posting frequency patterns
   - Healthcare-specific hashtag performance

3. **Intelligent Insights Without Direct API**
   - Content pattern analysis from user data
   - Optimal posting time recommendations
   - AHPRA compliance correlation with engagement
   - Competition benchmarking from public data

#### **CALENDAR ENGINE ROOM - GOOGLE/APPLE QUALITY REBUILD**

1. **AdvancedHealthcareCalendar.tsx**
   - Drag & drop functionality
   - Multi-view support (day/week/month/agenda)
   - Real-time sync across devices
   - Multi-practice switching

2. **VoicePoweredIdeaCapture.tsx**
   ```typescript
   // Voice Command Examples:
   "Hey JB, I have a Facebook post idea about managing diabetes in elderly patients"
   "Hey JB, create an Instagram post about exercise safety for heart patients"
   "Hey JB, I need a LinkedIn article about telehealth best practices"
   ```

3. **SmartContentSketchboard.tsx**
   - Visual idea capture (draw/write content concepts)
   - AI analysis of sketches and notes
   - Conversion to structured content plans
   - Platform optimization suggestions

4. **MultiPracticeCalendarSwitcher.tsx**
